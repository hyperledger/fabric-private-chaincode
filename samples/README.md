# Hyperledger Fabric Private Chaincode Samples

In the [samples](samples) folder you find a few examples how to develop applications using FPC and run them
on a Fabric network.
In particular, [samples/application](samples/application) contains examples of the FPC Client SDK for Go.
In [samples/chaincode](samples/chaincode) we illustrate the use of the FPC Chaincode API;
and in [samples/deployment](samples/deployment) we show how to deploy and run FPC chaincode on the Fabric-samples test network and with K8s (minikube).
