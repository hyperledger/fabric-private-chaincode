export DOCKER_BUILDKIT ?= 0 
# Building with build-kit makes multi-stage builds more efficient
# and also provides nicer output. However, as docker from older
# versions of ubuntu 18.04 can hang and travis explicitly rejects
# (rather than ignores) it, we support both and leave the default
# as a more robust 0. If you prefer the benefits of buildkit,
# override default in your `config.override.mk`
DOCKERFLAGS :=
DOCKER_CMD := docker
# Note:
# - to get quiet docker builds, you can define in config.override.mk
#   DOCKER_QUIET_BUILD=1
# - similarly you could also always turn off docker caching and force
#   a complete rebuild by defining DOCKER_FORCE_REBUILD=1 (although
#   this will have drastic performance implication and you might be better
#   off doing that selectively on particular builds and/or use 
#   `make clobber`.
# - also useful docker overrides are following variables which allow you
#   to add additional apt packages to various docker images
#   - DOCKER_BASE_RT_IMAGE_APT_ADD_PKGS (for all infrastructure containers)
#   - DOCKER_BASE_DEV_IMAGE_APT_ADD_PKGS (for all images which build fabric/fpc code)
#   - DOCKER_DEV_IMAGE_APT_ADD_PKGS (for dev image)
