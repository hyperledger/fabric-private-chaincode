    This box abstracts all other orgs and components.

note over Admin
    Admin uses the fpc-peer wrappers, which abstract the Fabric Peer CLI.

note over FPC_Peer1_CLI_Wrapper
    The following bookking operations help remember (across lifecycle calls)
    that a package (id) corresponds to a FPC chaincode. Similarly, the
    approve will later store data for an FPC chaincode installed locally,
    and the commit checks for data of a locally-approved FPC chaincode.
    Also, it should be noted that
    - the install lifecycle op is peer-specific, while
    - the approveformyorg is org-specific, to be run on at most one org's peer
    - the commit op has to be run on a single peer
    The current bookeeping ops expect the approve and commit ops to
    run on peers where the FPC chaincode has been previously installed.

    Sequence: sequence_number, Endorsement Policy: (2of3),
    Plugins: <ecc validation plugin>
    NOTE: the endorsement policy specifies how many enclaves are expected to run the chaincode.
    In the initial version of FPC, a specific FPC chaincode will be implemented to run on
    a "designated" peer. Hence, initially, the endorsement policy will require a single endorser.
    FPC is expected to support multiple endorsers in the future. To have an idea of how FPC will
    enalve multiple endorsers, please check out the diagram describing
    how secret/private keys are expected to be distributed among endorsing chaincode enclaves.
    NOTE: FPC does not support custom user plugins.

note over FPC_Peer1_CLI_Wrapper
    To complete setting up an FPC chaincode, enclaves have to be registered and provisioned with keys.
    See the separate UML diagrams `fpc-registration` and `fpc-key-dist`
    for the corresponding admin commands and protocol flows.
