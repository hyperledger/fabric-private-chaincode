note left ERCC1
  ERCC can be **integrated** in ECC or as **seperate** chaincode
  Integrated:
  - ERCC and ECC share endorsement policy (but need different "type": org-based vs. attestation-based)
  - attestations stored ECC namespace
  Separate: <- we use this one
  - flexible endorsement policies (ERCC and ECC can have different)
  - attestations stored in ERCC namespace
end note

note left ERCC1
  FPC chaincode has three different associated endorsement policies (EP):
  - lifecycle transactions ("normal fabric": approve chaincode definition (define application transaction EP), upgrade, etc ...)
  - application transactions
  - FPC-lifecycle transactions (register, key-gen, key-dist, ...)

  Decision: We use a **separate** ERCC.
  We realized FPC-liflecycle as application transaction EP of ERCC chaincode;
  should ideally match lifecycle EP which is 'Channel/Application/LifecycleEndorsement' and by default majority of organizations)
  Note that with the **integrated** approach we have deal with a mix of applications transactions EP and FPC-lifecycle EP.
end note

ref over User1, ERCC1
  Create channel; each peer joins channel; each peer launches TLCC, which will  "imprint" itself with CH_id (content-addressable channel identifier, hash of gensis block)
end ref
|||

ref over User1, ERCC1
  Install and approve ERCC chaincode. ERCC defines TLCC_MR and IAS_PK in chaincode definition.
  (alternatively, TLCC_MR and IAS_PK could be in channel configuration; crucial is that they are approved by humans (admins) on sufficiently many organizations)
  ERCC also reads CH_id from ledger or, if that does not work, also embeds it into chaincode

  end note

    **MST**: we might want to replace (here and elsewhere) CC_VER with the sequence
    number from chain code definition as versions can be re-used in downgrades yet we
    might or might not want to re-use enclaves?

  note over TLCC1
    This information could also be retrieved elsewhere if easier. At this point in time
    it does not have to be authenticated (and is anyway passed through untrusted ECC),
    consistency will be verified later in registration (Remember that TLCC_MR is defined
    and agreed by human consensus in the ERCC chaincode definition)

  Manager1 -> IAS ++: send quote

  note over Manager1 #FFaa00
    **MST**: From an attestation generalization perspective i think there should be just a single
    call ""GetAttestationProof"" or alike rather than a separate place where you get quote
    and another where you get the registration report which requires some re-organization of calls.
    A few observations on this:
    - we do not strictly have to call the enclave via ECC. ECCManager could also directly call
      enclave.so. this would make this creation and key-management potentially easier?
    - the quote generation is not driven from within the enclave as currently shown above but from
      the outside!
    I think from a high-level there should be following three high-level calls either in
    ECC or ECCMAnager depending on above:
    - EnclaveCreate (key-gen & imprint of context, i.e., current create/binding flows
    - EnclaveProof: gets org endorsement-sig, creates report, then quote
      and, if epid, gets IAS report. 
    - EnclavePersist: returns sealed state (important for security that this is called only after
      EnclaveProof [which we might want to enforce using some state-machine?] )
  end note
