title Fabric Private Chaincode - Transaction validation with MSP

actor "User Org1" as User1 order 9

participant "Peer Org1" as ECC1 order 30
participant "Peer Org2" as ECC2 order 60
participant "Peer Org3" as ECC3 order 70

entity Orderer order 100

ref over User1, Orderer
    install, approve, commit chaincode definition (ECC_MR)
    Example endorsement policies:
        - ( 2 of 3 enclaves of different Orgs )

    see fpc-lifecycle-v2.puml
end ref

note right ECC3 #FFaa00
    How can we express that we need an enclave here?
    In particular, an enclave that has ECC_MR and also has a valid attestation?!
end note

ref over User1, Orderer
    register enclaves and key-dist
    see fpc-registration.puml and fpc-key-dist.puml
end ref

note right Orderer #FFaa00
    After discussion with Angelo with have two options:

    1) MSP integration via explicit chaincode endorsement policies
        where we first register all enclaves and then update
        the chaincode policy and state explicitly which enclaves
        can endorse.

    2) We create a new MPS principle which, when presents,
        triggers the peer to check the attestation report attached
        to an enclave x509 cert.

    Detailed evaluation of those two approaches is needed.

    MORE DETAILS later here ...

                the following steps:
                    - is endorsing enclave part of Org_i?
                    - has enclave a proper attestation?
                    - is this enclave also registered to
                      perform execution of this chaincode?
